## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Claude Code plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/`), so the CLI, its MCP server and the
  Agent Skills install as one plugin.
- A changelog and a code of conduct.

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

First public release of PROCESIO CLI + Agent.

### Added
- The PROCESIO CLI: every platform API action as a subcommand, plus a generic `request`
  for anything not wrapped.
- A local MCP server, so an AI coding assistant can drive the platform over stdio.
- Agent Skills carrying the build, verify and audit method.
- Credentials in the operating system's secret store, never in a file.
- Irreversible actions stop and ask before they run.
